<p> &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p> Glen MacDonald couldn't believe what he had just heard from his supervisor, 
  Davis Fenster.</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes&#8221; grated Fenster &#8220;you heard me, MacDonald! The Subatomic 
  Energy Division is being shut down, effective as of tomorrow!&#8221;</p>
<p> MacDonald stepped forward, looming over the shorter Fenster and his desk. 
  MacDonald was six-foot-four, three hundred pounds of muscle that his fighting 
  Scots ancestors would have admired. His kilt bore the ancestral MacDonald tartan. 
  His ham-like hands gripped the edge of the desk as he glared at Fenster. The 
  autovidphone buzzed, but neither man moved. </p>
<p>&#8220;Listen&#8221; said Glen evenly, through his teeth, &#8220;The Subatomic 
  Energy Division was the best thing this company had going for it! We were on 
  the verge of a breakthrough that will solve the problem of free energy for the 
  next thousand years! And now you throw all that away! All I want to know is 
  why!&#8221; </p>
<p>Fenster seemed to shrink. &#8220;Policy from upstairs. &#8221; he muttered. 
</p>
<p>Upstairs! MacDonald knew what that meant. He had run-ins with the double-domes 
  before. &#8220;The physicists&#8221; he snarled. </p>
<p>&#8220;They say the figures don't add up, Glen!&#8221; Fenster pleaded. &#8220;They 
  say you're building a perpetual motion machine!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Have they ever turned a valve or milled a hollowground Jorgenson cube?&#8221; 
  demanded MacDonald. &#8220;Those scientists tear down the work of men like me 
  because they look down their noses at us engineers! We deal with physical reality 
  every day! Toe to toe with Mother Nature! They think everything is an equation!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The autovidphone buzzed again. &#8220;Call for you from Science Central&#8221; 
  said Patrice, Fenster's lovely, but intelligent secretary. She saw Glen in the 
  office, and for a microsecond, their glances locked. </p>
<p>Glen had had enough. He turned on his heel and stalked out. As he passed through 
  the outer office, he saw Patrice again. &#8220;Giving you a hard ride, Glen?&#8221; 
  she asked. Glen approved of the way her syntho-Angora sweater rode out her own 
  curves. </p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8221; he replied. His steely grey eyes softened for a moment. 
  &#8220;Don't worry about me, kid.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Keep slugging, big boy.&#8221; she advised. &#8220;Silver lining in 
  every cloud, you know.&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen smiled for a moment. He would have liked to stay, but he knew there was 
  work to do now. </p>
<p>Glen MacDonald walked through the ultramodern glassite and steelio corridors 
  of the Technicorp Administration Hexacomplex Five. His big powerful strides 
  carried him along at twice the speed of the scientists and bureaucrats crowding 
  past him, his square-jawed, red- haired head visible above the sea of bald pates 
  and sunken chins. </p>
<p>Jim Harcourt approached him, visibly agitated. &#8220;Is it true, Glen? They're 
  shutting us down?&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen studied Jim for a split second. Harcourt was one of his best assistants 
  - a topflight mechanical engineer. Even though Jim was black, Glen reflected, 
  that didn't stop him from being treated exactly like every other member of the 
  team. No irrational racial prejudice in engineering! </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are, Jim. Fenster gave me the bad word just now.&#8221; &#8220;Fungo!&#8221; 
  Jim swore. &#8220;Those sheet chewers! Why?&#8221; Glen laid a giant hand on 
  Jim's shoulder. &#8220;The physicists put the Indian sign on us, Jim. Said the 
  numbers didn't tickle their fancy the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p> Jim shook his head. &#8220;There's more than just those pen-pushers at work 
  here.&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen nodded his great head slowly. Neither of them had to say a word. They 
  both knew that the physicists were just the paid lapdogs of the world-wide managerialist 
  conspiracy. All over the world, accountants and department heads called the 
  shots and sent out the directives that kept their stodgy, unimaginative tyranny 
  in operation. They liked conventional science because they knew it could never 
  challenge their power - or their appropriations. Glen, a supreme individualist 
  and all-around maverick was constantly jousting with their one-track minds and 
  their bean-counting ways. All engineers did, of course, but Glen MacDonald had 
  the wild, fey Highlands blood coursing through his veins, and they were afraid 
  of him - afraid of his ham-like fists as well as his keen, canny mind. </p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Jim&#8221; Glen's deep voice rumbled &#8220;We haven't played 
  all the cards in our hand yet. Lets get back to Energylab and talk to the rest 
  of the crew.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p> Felix Mahlstadt looked out the window at the Technicorp rocket- plane pad, 
  fixated on the flashing green lights that led into the distance like some sacred 
  road. He adjusted one of his vanadium cufflinks and sighed, returning to his 
  desk. The last honey-colored daylight was falling across the floor. </p>
<p>Felix bent to pick up a pen as the autovidphone buzzed. He answered it. </p>
<p>&#8220;Felix?&#8221; Mike Kopachevsky's thick voice came across the line. &#8220;Hello, 
  Mike. What is going on?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it's really strange... There has been some kind of security leak 
  or something, because a whole bunch of people have gathered out at the front 
  gate chanting and yelling about the Subatomic Energy Project.&#8221;Kopachevsky 
  sounded incredulous. </p>
<p>&#8220;Chanting? How many people? Mike, are you pulling my leg?&#8221; Felix 
  demanded. &#8220;Is this because of that jab about sin x/n = 6 in the newsletter? 
  You know I didn't mean...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No. This is real. Security is trying to find out how it slipped. Anyhow, 
  public relations is sending someone to talk to them but it might be good if 
  the head of R&amp;D was there too.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;You're right Mike. What absurd positions one gets into when promoted! 
  I'll head down as soon as possible.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;That's a good idea, Felix. It will also keep you from having to explain 
  the situation to that crazy MacDonald,&#8221; Mike chuckled. &#8220;I just talked 
  to Davis Fenster and he said MacDonald was on his way out. He might be on his 
  way here.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Felix laughed. &#8220;Well it was a matter of time. Those 
  engineers never let go of anything. They are like little garbage magnets! I 
  will talk to you later, Mike.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;See you Felix,&#8221; Mike hung up. </p>
<p>Felix walked over to the mirror, slicked his black hair back with his thin, 
  distinguished hand, and straightened his tie. He relished the opportunity to 
  play at &#8220;technocrat&#8221; before an audience and even, perhaps, vid cameras. 
  On the other hand, it annoyed him that MacDonald was causing trouble again. 
  Those stupid technicians! What they lacked in brains they made up for in cheap 
  machismo and dog-like persistence. This infinite energy foolishness had always 
  appeared under various guises and would certainly continue to do so, but to 
  be its victim was embarrassing. Of course, it was understandable... Felix wouldn't 
  be an engineer for all the poly-creds in the world, even if he didn't have to 
  drink their cheap, evil smelling beer. </p>
<p>He left the office and strolled over to the secretary's desk, but Mona had 
  gone home. He went to the file cabinet and found the latest bulletin from MacDonald's 
  benighted project, and read it as he rode first down the elevator and then on 
  the sleek, silvery personnel conveyance to the front gate. The bulletin was 
  written mostly by that monomaniac MacDonald himself. It described the design 
  of their latest gadget, the cyclo-gradient dyad separator. He snickered. As 
  he turned the page however, Felix's face darkened. That idiot Calhoun was trying 
  to use Felix's own results in ergodic Venn-lattices to model their &#8220;pion 
  resonance sub-factor&#8221;. That was the final straw. </p>
<p>As he walked out of Facility 1 toward the gate he was approached by a beautiful 
  but uncompromising girl with long chestnut hair and tinted vis-o-glasses. who 
  extended her hand. &#8220;Are you Dr. Mahlstadt? I'm Arlene Cooper, from P.R.&#8221; 
  she smiled at him. </p>
<p>He shook her hand and smiled back. &#8220;Yes, I'm Mahlstadt. I'm glad you're 
  here. Do you know what these people want exactly?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the group seems mostly comprised of little old ladies, and what 
  I suppose are college students and political cranks. They say that subatomic 
  energy is unnatural,&#8221; she explained as they walked across the lawn together. 
</p>
<p>Felix laughed out loud. &#8220;Well that's true at least! It's an impossibilty!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose the security leak occurred?&#8221; she asked as 
  they walked across the Asfalt. &#8220;Or is that too hush-hush?&#8221; </p>
<p>Felix looked at her. She was dressed in a fashionable brick-red caftan and 
  black leggings. Arlene had the assured self confidence characteristic of all 
  marketing and public relations workers. Perhaps it came from knowing that her 
  neck was never on the line, that she was just there to help other people escape 
  the guillotine.</p>
<p> &#8220;I suspect that MacDonald has been flapping his great maw in some local 
  bar,&#8221; he replied. </p>
<p>Finally they passed through the gate and saw a crowd of emotional young people 
  and resolute old people, some carrying signs saying &#8220;Enough S.E.D.&#8221; 
  or &#8220;Down with Atomic Playboys!&#8221; and even one besmirching Dr. Mahlstadt 
  personally. </p>
<p>Arlene waved the crowd down and said &#8220;We are here to make an announcement! 
  We appreciate your concern!&#8221; The mob quieted somewhat and she said &#8220;Here 
  is Dr. Felix Mahlstadt, head of research and development for Technicorp, to 
  explain the situation.&#8221; Amid a few boos and a little more chanting, Felix 
  stepped forward. &#8220;Good afternoon! I'd like to thank you all for coming 
  down today; it's concerned citizens like you that make democracy work.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>He was rudely interrupted by several students chanting &#8220;Feed the people, 
  not the reactor!&#8221; They bore an enormous banner picturing a clumsily scrawled 
  mushroom cloud. A middle aged, professorial-looking man started sputtering &#8220;How 
  dare you talk about democracy, when you criminals are holding our country hostage 
  to your...&#8221; Felix shrugged and continued. &#8220;At any rate, there seems 
  to be some concern about a 'Subatomic Energy Division' I believe it was called, 
  and I'd like to assure you that here at Technicorp no research is being done 
  in that direction. I don't know where this rumor came from but that is all it 
  is, a rumor. To be honest, I don't believe this subatomic energy stuff works 
  anyway.&#8221; He smiled his &#8220;good-natured&#8221; smile. &#8220;Some researcher 
  told the newspapers about the idea before he even told the rest of the scientific 
  world. I say its a publicity stunt, and we at Technicorp do not involve ourselves 
  in such things.&#8221; </p>
<p>Suddenly a rather unkempt young man lunged at him. Felix jumped back in alarm 
  as two company guards rushed forward and wrestled the man to the ground. Arlene 
  stepped forward quickly. &#8220;Dr. Mahlstadt will not be answering any questions 
  at this time!&#8221; She and Felix ducked back in the gate.</p>
<hr>
<p> &#8220;Power to the Net!&#8221; shouted Arvid Schiller, watching the demonstration 
  on his bootlegged vidreciever. He manipulated the keys on an ancient Commodore 
  64 computer he wore on a strap around his neck. The picture on the screen was 
  overlaid with the bright day-glo orange logo of the Neo-Anarchoids - a cartoon 
  skull with a computer chip stuck through it. </p>
<p>The dingy, drab little room in the abandoned glassite processing facility was 
  filled with people dressed in black canvas and ragged T- shirts with faded corporate 
  logos. This was &#8220;Nagoya&#8221;, the quasi- headquarters of the Neo-Anarchoids 
  - outlaw hackers and 8-bit cowboys all. Arvid bounced the logo around the vidscreen 
  as the others cheered and hooted. The Neo-Anarchoids wanted to have the logo 
  overlay all the vidscreens throughout the world, but months of fevered hacking 
  with their souped-up Commodore 64's and TI 99/4A decks had failed to crack the 
  communication companies code. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fung on you, Mahlstadt!&#8221; screamed &#8220;Creamball&#8221; Johanson, 
  one of the Neo-Anarchoids' most pertinacious hackers. Creamball was a short 
  boy with crater acne and a tee-shirt bearing a puff-ink image of Mussolini, 
  but using a virt-reality headset he had once hacked his way deep into the virtual 
  world of a &#8220;Burger Castle&#8221; order-taking computer. He had hit a patch 
  of black ice surrounding the sales-tax database and lain paralyzed with ECG-shock 
  for three days. </p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door. &#8220;Password!&#8221; demanded Arvid, as the 
  rest tensed. Could it be Technicorp security? &#8220;Uh...'Joseph Chamberlain'&#8221; 
  came the muffled response from behind the door. &#8220;Check him!&#8221; snarled 
  Arvid, motioning to a fat, frizzy-haired girl with an Atari 800. She found a 
  tape cassette under a pile of dirty laundry, loaded it into the cassette drive. 
  Minutes passed as the Neo- Anarchoids security program loaded in. She put on 
  the virt-harness and her eyes rolled up into her head. She was, Arvid knew, 
  being plunged into a blue, bitty vert world with big orange letters. Her fingers 
  flew over the keyboard. The person outside coughed and shuffled his feet. &#8220;S'all 
  right&#8221; she gasped as Johanson tore off the harness. Arvid immediately 
  keyed in the door combination on his deck and the lock opened. </p>
<p>A tall thin young man stumbled in, still dressed in Technicorp lower-management 
  blue serge. &#8220;What's going on, Phil?&#8221; Arvid demanded, as the rest 
  gathered around the new arrival. &#8220;Technicorp's shutting down SAE.&#8221; 
  replied Phil &#8220;I got a hardcopy of the memo from a wastebasket. But I hear 
  MacDonald's not going to stand for it!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;They can't shut it down&#8221; snarled Arvid again, wiping a lank strand 
  of greasy black hair from his forehead. &#8220;We need the Subatomic Project 
  for our master anarchy plan! It's the only way to bring down this oppressive 
  power structure!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Everything's being scrapped and carted off tomorrow morning, Arvid. 
  I saw the gluon cutters being brought up to the main gate!&#8221; </p>
<p>Arvid paused a moment. He turned on the fat girl. &#8220;Denise, have you decoded 
  those punch cards Phil swiped from the SAE computer yet?&#8221; </p>
<p>Denise nodded. &#8220;I've made up the preliminary access cards already, Arvid. 
  All we need is the final access code that the engineers are using!&#8221; Her 
  voice reflected both her longing for Arvid's hot nihilistic love and her existential 
  despair of ever experiencing it. Stories she had heard from a VIC-20 groupie 
  were both terrifying and strangely compelling. </p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; Arvid's eyes flashed &#8220;Tonight's our only chance! 
  We must get into Technicorp tonight and get into that computer!&#8221; </p>
<hr>
<p>Inside the great central energy facility a dispirited group gathered around 
  the mighty steelio container vessel of the Subatomic Energy Project. They were 
  all project engineers, normally a high-spirited, beer- drinking lot, men who 
  worked hard, sweating the details, and played hard, sweating like pigs. Now 
  they saw the failure of all they had tried to accomplish staring them in the 
  face. Strong men with chiseled features bit back bitter curses as they reached 
  for another can of cheap, evil smelling beer. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fung it all!&#8221; shouted Rory Calhoun, a big bear of a man. &#8220;Let 
  'em all go to schenectady if they don't want infinite power for nothing!&#8221; 
  A deep murmur of agreement greeted these words. </p>
<p>Suddenly, all heads turned, all voices stilled. Glen McDonald and Jim Harcourt 
  had entered the chamber. McDonald strode into their midst with a self-assured 
  power. He clapped a big hand on Calhoun's shoulder. &#8220;Mankind needs what 
  we've got, Rory,&#8221; McDonald rumbled &#8220;Would we be keeping faith with 
  our children and our children's children if we let the small-minded and the 
  envious stop us now?&#8221; Rory hung his grizzled head. &#8220;You're right, 
  Glen. I don't know why I said that. &#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Good man&#8221; said Glen, and then turned to the rest of the engineers. 
  &#8220;Listen, men. G.Harry Stine said decades ago that progress was like a 
  curve, and that someday everybody on earth would be commanding the power of 
  a sun for their personal use! We're not there yet, and why?&#8221; He paused. 
  &#8220;You know why as well as I do! It's not in the interest of the big boys 
  that men have the freedom of infinite power! And the big-brain scientists stick 
  to their rules and laws they get out of books, while we engineers do the real 
  work! We're on the verge of ultimate energy here! There's only one way to save 
  our work - we have to get the system running tonight!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;But Glen&#8221; Jim said &#8220;we'll need months of adjusting power 
  settings to find the right harmonic balance - we haven't got an erg of output 
  from the system yet! I know we're close, but...&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It's our only chance!&#8221; boomed Glen. &#8220;Either we make it tonight 
  or we - and mankind - have lost the biggest race of them all!&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;I can't believe it! One of them tried to attack you?&#8221; Mike Kopachevsky 
  was sitting on Felix's desk spinning a colorful cardboard dodecahedron between 
  his massive index fingers. &#8220;That's just nuts! What a bunch of fobbers...&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Felix waved his hand in annoyance. &#8220;All of this trouble for one delusional 
  engineer. I think we should fire him, because I am sure the security leak was 
  his fault.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps firing him would not be the most useful thing to do, Dr. Mahlstadt, 
  if you don't mind my saying so,&#8221; Arlene put in. </p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Ms. Cooper?&#8221; Mike turned to her. </p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if this subatomic energy stuff works, then he'll take it somewhere 
  else, maybe to Inter-Atomix. And, conversely, if it doesn't work, then he'll 
  just head right off to secure an interview on the Harry Nickerson show or something 
  and, well, the publicity is hardly something you need now.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, of course. We must keep him here where we can keep control 
  of him. However, we should get together Vandenloos and Wang and anyone else 
  we can find to go shut down their project tonight. As department head, I feel 
  that I should have a word with MacDonald personally. But I would feel better 
  with a couple of allies along.&#8221; Dr. Mahlstadt laughed and walked over 
  to the bar.&#8220;Perhaps I'm just nervous from having been attacked by one 
  lunatic already today.&#8221; </p>
<p>The burly Kopachevsky stood up and walked toward the door. &#8220;It's appropriate 
  for the physicists and mathematicians to shut the thing down anyway. After all, 
  the engineers create the end product which begins with our work, so I think 
  we should take action now to bring this 'product' of theirs to the only conceivable 
  end it could have - if only in the interest of symmetry. I'll round up whichever 
  Review Committee members are still here.&#8221; He walked out. </p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish to accompany us to Energylab?&#8221; Felix asked the girl 
  sitting in his chair. &#8220;I suspect that you might provide a needed voice 
  of reason.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I'll come. Perhaps this can all go on my resume later on.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p> It was dark as the 1981 Pontiac Sunbird pulled up to the Technicorp main gate. 
  Rain was coming down now on the hood of the car, the security booth, and the 
  last of the demonstrators, two bedraggled girls under an opened sleeping bag. 
  They yelled insults at the Sunbird. </p>
<p>Behind the wheel, Phil admonished Arvid and Denise to stay down on the floor 
  and stay quiet while he showed his ID to the guard. &#8220;Fungo! What do you 
  take us for, Speak &amp; Spell jockeys or somethin' ?&#8221; Arvid sneered, 
  before Phil shushed him and rolled down the window. </p>
<p>Soon they were headed toward Parking Bay 5, and the two hidden Neo-Anarchoids 
  risked sitting up. As they drove past Bay 2, the parking for the R&amp;D department, 
  Phil noted that Dr. Mahlstadt's old Volkswagen Thing and MacDonald's aircar 
  were still there.</p>
<p> &#8220;That means we might have a chance at that fobber first hand!&#8221; 
  Denise exclaimed. &#8220;They won't keep us down any more, huh Arvid? Now it's 
  our turn! Let the Kids run things for a change!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it's gonna be Mega!&#8221; Arvid agreed, scratching inside his 
  T- shirt. &#8220;This place is bigger than I thought, Phil.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;This isn't even half of it...these fungers have their own rocket- plane 
  launch!&#8221; Phil told them. &#8220;Oh, there's Bay 5. We're there now.&#8221; 
</p>
<hr>
<p>MacDonald was pacing. &#8220;Mass into energy&#8221; he muttered &#8220;Subatomic 
  mass into subatomic energy through harmonic vibrations in the space-time continuum! 
  That's the final equation! The key! How to unlock it in time?&#8221; </p>
<p>The others stood back, not daring to interrupt the giant engineer. Jim and 
  Rory were at the GENIAC terminal, feeding in punch cards, working out thousands 
  of possible vibration-patterns to feed into the great banks of resonating bi-polar 
  attenuators looming above them, glistening black plastika stacks reaching up 
  into the dim heights of the ceiling. </p>
<p>The attenuators worked on the pulsed bi-polar resonation principle, and their 
  &#8220;vibration wave-front&#8221; was aimed directly into the three-story square 
  steelio subatomic chamber, where the vast cthonic energies of the subatomic 
  &#8220;multi-universes&#8221; would be liberated to heat syntho-sodium in great 
  pipes, providing unlimited power! </p>
<p>Jim came up to MacDonald, looking worried. Inner doubt seemed to be gnawing 
  at him. &#8220;Glen&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I've thought of a moral angle 
  to this whole project.&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen MacDonald turned his level gaze on his old pal. &#8220;Spit it out, Jim. 
  We're all engineers here.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we know that subatomic particles consist of tiny little galaxies, 
  solar systems and planets, all whirling through the subatomic void. Sagan's 
  Law proves that all of these planets must have intelligent life on them, and 
  advanced civilizations with cultures of their own. Our power plan works by disrupting 
  the subatomic suns and smashing the subatomic planets to liberate the potential 
  base energy charge within! Do we really have the right to destroy these other 
  universes? For all we know, a duplicate Glen MacDonald and Jim Harcourt might 
  be on one of them right now.&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen, for the first time in many hard, grueling hours, broke into a smile. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, you've answered your question by asking it!&#8221; Glen clapped 
  a friendly hand on Jim's shoulder. &#8220;If there were a Glen MacDonald and 
  a Jim Harcourt on one of these planets, or creatures sufficiently like us to 
  worry about, they would have long before now discovered our plans and found 
  a way to make themselves known to us. Well, they haven't and so that's that. 
  No need to worry about it, Jim! I know these moral angles can be real brain-busters, 
  but I find all it takes is hard straight thinking for a few moments to clear 
  them right up!&#8221; </p>
<p>Greatly relieved, Jim returned to his work at the GENIAC terminal. </p>
<hr>
<p> The great machines throbbed and hummed in the huge hall. From a nearby darkened 
  alcove the engineers - even Glen MacDonald - looked like ants crowded around 
  the terminals. </p>
<p>Inside the alcove crouched the contingent of Neo-Anarchoids. Arvid stealthily 
  withdrew the parabolic disk microphone he had been aiming at the group. He stuffed 
  the microphone into his backpack and popped the tape cassette of the recording 
  out of the specially modified Fisher-Price &#8220;My First Tape Deck&#8221; 
  attached to his belt. </p>
<p>&#8220;Got every word!&#8221; Arvid sneered, slipping the cassette into one 
  of the pockets of his stained &#8220;cyber-vest&#8221;. &#8220;Sub-atomic universe, 
  huh! Those dopey engineers are all goobered! The future belongs to Cyber Anarchy!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Denise looked longingly at Arvid's feral little face and stringy black goatee. 
  In the half-light, for a moment, she thought of Arvid as a cross between Robert 
  Anton Wilson and Charles Manson. Her loins ached... </p>
<p>&#8220;Shhh!&#8221; hissed Phil frantically. &#8220;We've got to get out of 
  here!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah, you skanky corpo wanger! Don't tell me what to do! Everybody 
  over into the next exit!&#8221; </p>
<p>The little group of terrorists slipped into the darkened side hallway. They 
  crept down the corridor, past the empty offices. Phil stopped at one door. &#8220;This 
  is it.&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;This is where the alternate terminal station 
  is.&#8221; </p>
<p>Arvid produced a set of lockpicks and worked at the door lock for twenty minutes, 
  before finally taking out a crowbar from his pack and prying the door open. 
  Inside, the heat and noise were almost unbearable. The office actually faced 
  onto the giant building where the GENIAC operated. </p>
<p>Through the glassite windows of the control chamber, they could see mile upon 
  mile of sliding ribbons of steelio, shifting back and forth, grinding and pounding 
  away at hundreds of calculations every second. The machine was working on harmonic 
  combinations for MacDonald and his group. The terminals were blank metal boxes 
  with input and output slots. Punch-card devices were at each desk, and a punch-card 
  reader stood in the corner. </p>
<p>Arvid popped the tape back into the cassette machine and replayed the engineer's 
  conversation. All listened intently. In the background, as Glen and Jim were 
  talking, they could hear Rory working at one of the machine room terminals. 
  &#8220;2234&#8221;, they heard him say faintly. </p>
<p>&#8220;That's it!&#8221; cried Denise &#8220;The access code!&#8221; </p>
<p>She took a blank card from a dispenser on the wall, shoved it into a card puncher 
  and pushed in the numbers &#8220;2&#8221;, &#8220;2&#8221;, &#8220;3&#8221; 
  and &#8220;4&#8221;. She took the punched card and fed it into the input slot 
  of the terminal nearest her. </p>
<p>A row of green light bulbs flashed on the wall opposite them, and an ACCESS 
  CONFIRMED panel lit up. </p>
<p>They were in. </p>
<p>Arvid leaned forward. His thin, wasted little body shook with excitement. This 
  was what he lived for, balancing on the edge of the big curve. Beating the dead 
  hand of the oppressive System! The kids knew what the Gutenberg-oriented adults 
  did not - that the cyber-world of the future was theirs to take. The cyber-kids, 
  the skater gangs, the carbon tet trippers and the Neo-Anarchoids were surfing 
  the electronic wave, flowing with the Big Curve! Something Tim Leary had said 
  back in the dinosaur days seemed appropriate right now, if only he could remember 
  it. </p>
<p>&#8220;We're ready, Arvid.&#8221; Denise said. Without a word, Arvid pulled 
  the virt-harness out of the backpack and plugged it in to the socket on the 
  side of the terminal. He put it on and looked at the others &#8220;The funging 
  engineers don't have our outlaw virt-tech.&#8221; he said. &#8220;They're trying 
  to find the answers the old-style way, through a terminal. We'll get it before 
  they do! Then it's liberation of energy for Neo Anarchy!&#8221; </p>
<p>With a savage jab of his thumb, Arvid turned the harness on. </p>
<hr>
<p>Mike Kopachevsky made his way through Science Central, occasionally looking 
  into the offices of the department's crack science staff. His feet sounded heavily 
  in the quiet of the halls. He whistled an old Russian song as he went and smiled 
  with glee at the thought of the engineers with their infinite water wheel. </p>
<p>Turning a corner, Mike heard voices coming from an open door across the hall, 
  the door to Snack Shop 5. </p>
<p>&#8221;...something about harmonic resonance in the subatomic manifold. I'd 
  never heard such nonsense! I thought 'Does he know who he's talking to? Can 
  he really think he can snork me?' but I guess he did, poor guy.&#8221; It was 
  Joe Wang, a recent addition to the R&amp;D group and an ace solid- state man. 
  Mike stuck his head in the door and saw that with Wang was Erich Vandenloos, 
  a hotshot young mathematician who'd been working on the Discrete Ring Computability 
  Project. </p>
<p>The snack shop was a gleaming modern affair, with glassite tables and steelio-and-black 
  leatheron chairs. The table at which the scientists sat was piled with ersatz-tofu 
  pocket sandwiches, chips and sugarine snacks from the Dial-a-Snack set-up in 
  the corner. </p>
<p>Vandenloos smoked while Wang recounted his favorite tales of the engineers. 
  Bartok chamber music came across the quadrophonic hi-fi system. &#8220;Hello, 
  gentlemen,&#8221; Mike walked in. &#8220;Hard at work on subatomic energy I 
  see.&#8221; </p>
<p>They laughed and greeted him. &#8220;Have some Koffee, Mike, and tell us what's 
  new down at the Muon-permittivity lab,&#8221; Wang suggested. </p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, I'm here on business for a change... uh, Wang, would you hand 
  me one of those Pep-cakes... You see, those bozos down at Energylab aren't giving 
  up. They're at it down there tonight. Furthermore, we think MacDonald told somebody 
  outside about the Division and there was a near riot right outside the gate. 
  Some doped-up beatnik tried to assault Felix!&#8221;The other men gasped. </p>
<p>Mike continued &#8220;So Felix and I thought we'd head down there tonight and 
  stop them before they hurt themselves, and we thought it would be better to 
  have some other guys from 'Central along.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;You can count on us, Mike-O,&#8221; laughed Wang. &#8220;We'll show 
  those cloddys something!&#8221;</p>
<p> Vandenloos smiled enigmatically and they all finished their snacks and Koffee. 
</p>
<hr>
<p> Arvid was spinning down into a dark well. </p>
<p>It was the familiar but exciting, and somewhat sickening, feeling of leaving 
  the world of the straights and the fobbers for his world. If only everything 
  could be as hype as this! But then it would be, once the master anarchy plan 
  was complete. </p>
<p>His thoughts of victory were cut short by the need to find his bearings. Looking 
  down at his virt-body, Arvid saw his long, thin legs wrapped in shiny charcoal 
  leatheron and boots with chromanium shin- guards. Across and around his torso 
  was a network of straps and wires and cords. Once Cyber-Anarchy was in place, 
  he'd look like this all the time, and trash that 'Mr. Bubble' T-shirt. </p>
<p>Arvid looked around, and was annoyed to discover that he was in an area that 
  looked like a junior high school gym. The floor wasn't wood, however, but shimmering 
  yellow. Like any gym floor, it was covered by circles and lines, with a big 
  'T' in the center circle. The whole scene was bathed in an eerie green light 
  which came from two signs, one on either side, reading &#8220;EXIT.&#8221; </p>
<p>Underneath these signs were door icons; there were also two more door icons 
  with no signs. Above, the place just stretched away farther than Arvid could 
  see. </p>
<p>Suddenly it dawned on him that those marks on the floor were like a map to 
  the whole system. That 'T' was the main memory bank! But where was he on this 
  map? </p>
<p>Arvid puzzled over this, and then realized that he was just where he was standing! 
  The map was to show him where to go, so it must start where he started! </p>
<p>He peered around and decided after some thought not to go through the &#8220;exit.&#8221; 
  Instead he went toward one of the other doors. He passed through the icon and 
  found himself in a blank white world with a black rectangle some distance away. 
  He tried to go to the rectangle, but it was like walking on a slippery surface 
  and he kept losing his balance. </p>
<p>But eventually he made it to the dark spot, which proved to be another door 
  icon. As he passed through, he noted that he was now in a higher traffic area. 
  Red, spherical info-packets slid past. There was a loud clackety sound coming 
  from somewhere. That made sense; it was the card reader, and he would be near 
  the I/O portal. </p>
<p>He decided to follow the red packets, thinking that they led further into the 
  system. The spheres led him on a circuitous journey through the giant cyber-technoverse. 
  This was the best curve he'd ever ridden and at this point, he didn't care whether 
  he lived or died because this was it, the ultimate mega-hack! </p>
<p>Eventually, he came to a large planar area in which the spheres one by one 
  dropped into depressions in the floor. Far away, other spheres were popping 
  back up and going out, presumably to the stupid engineers' terminal. This had 
  to be the central processing unit! All of this information entered through those 
  holes. </p>
<p>Arvid went over to one and jumped in. He found himself surrounded by colorful 
  grids, like plaid, intermingling in the intricate dance of computation. It was 
  beautiful...but it didn't make any sense! Arvid realized that this machine was 
  more advanced than he had expected and tried to think of how to process the 
  information so that he could deal with it. </p>
<p>That's it! He began to form the info-buffer into a virt-terminal which was 
  in contact with the CPU. </p>
<p>He just typed on the keys; it didn't even need cards! He soon learned that 
  the frequency pattern sequence had already been computed and was queuing up 
  to return to the engineers. </p>
<p>Arvid had to act fast. He diverted the sequence toward the payroll banks to 
  buy some time while he set about finding the key to controlling the bi- polar 
  attenuator apparatus. </p>
<hr>
<p>Sweat rolled down Rory Calhoun's bloated face, making the normally stalwart 
  engineer resemble a drowned corpse. </p>
<p>&#8220;The GENIAC's on line but we aren't getting the frequency pattern sequence 
  we need!&#8221; Calhoun snarled. </p>
<p>Glen MacDonald manipulated a slide rule with expert fingers. &#8220;My calculations 
  show that GENIAC has the correct answer and that it should have come out of 
  the output slot three and five-sixteenths minutes ago! A mutant factor must 
  have entered the computations.&#8221; </p>
<p>His great brow furrowed. Slowly, the master engineer stood up and walked a 
  few paces into the middle of the room, his hob-nailed boots echoing on the cold 
  steelio plates of the floor. </p>
<p>MacDonald stared into space for a few seconds. The others watched in silence. 
  They knew that Glen MacDonald was deep in thought. Not ordinary thought alone, 
  however, for long ago in the giant engineer's youth, when he was only an orphaned 
  beggar boy wandering the streets of some nameless Eastern bazaar, he had been 
  processed into the esoteric mental discipline of Second Order Nexialism! Second 
  Order Nexialism! A higher form of null-Aristotelian analysis, combined with 
  the most rigorous and searching form of General Semantics. Trained to see the 
  map, not the territory, leaping far ahead of suppressive categorical imperatives, 
  MacDonald's canny Scots mind flashed from solution to inference!</p>
<p>&#8220;Calculations...computer...sequence...modern youth...door left ajar on 
  fifth floor...the mutant factor is...&#8221; But MacDonald was unable to complete 
  the inexorable Nexialist thought-map. </p>
<p>A pounding at the huge steelio doors at the far end of the chamber broke his 
  concentration, shattered the crystal purity of his inferential sequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fungo!&#8221; shouted Rory Calhoun. &#8220;What motherless ballpeen 
  could be coming here at this hour?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know,&#8221; replied MacDonald in an even voice. &#8220;Jim, 
  punch in the door-opening sequence. We've got visitors.&#8221; </p>
<p>The massive, five foot thick twin halves of the steelio doors slowly rotated 
  down into the floor. Overhead spotlights revealed a small group of men in white 
  lab coats, striding purposefully toward the group of engineers. Glen McDonald 
  instantly recognized the thin, ascetic form of Dr. Felix Mahlstadt, followed 
  by Mike Kopachevsky, Joe Wang, and Erich Vandenloos, the mathematician. Following 
  them was Arlene Cooper, clutching a briefcase. </p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I would find you all here,&#8221; said Dr. Mahlstadt. &#8220;Excellent! 
  That makes it more convenient to inform all of you at once that this project 
  has been terminated, and to begin shutdown and dismantlement procedures immediately.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it 'convenient' for mankind, Doctor?&#8221; said Jim Harcourt. &#8220;Do 
  your seminars and symposia hold as much promise for Man's future as our single 
  candle against the darkness of ignorance and want? Can't you see the truth of 
  what we might accomplish here tonight? Will you let it be stillborn?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>After a brief silence, in which the distant walls seemed to ring with Harcourt's 
  words, Mike Kopachevsky cleared his throat. &#8220;It's all a lot of nonsense&#8221; 
  he rumbled, &#8220;a complete waste of time and valuable resources. This facility 
  should have been turned over long ago to myself for our muon-permittivity research. 
  And here it is being used for you boys trying to square the circle!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Actually&#8221; murmured Vandenloos in a diffident manner to nobody 
  in particular, &#8220;I think it would make an ideal setting for Snack Shop 
  13. It's so stifling in 5 that we can't get anything done. We could put in a 
  swimming pool.&#8221; </p>
<p>Arlene Cooper took a notebook from her briefcase. &#8220;We've got a fascinating 
  sewage-treatment project in our Scrub and Sludge division, Mr. MacDonald. I'm 
  sure that would benefit mankind nearly as much as your very clever infinite 
  power idea.&#8221; </p>
<p>Rory Calhoun stepped up to Kopachevsky. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he grated through 
  clenched teeth. &#8220;you scientists burn my fundament! If you want to shut 
  us down, you have to be man enough to pass the test!&#8221; </p>
<p>The scientists looked at each other incredulously. &#8220;What kind of crazy 
  test are they talking about, Mike-O?&#8221; asked Joe Wang. </p>
<p>&#8220;A man. Four in the morning, two at noon and three at night. Now shut 
  it off, you buffoons,&#8221; Felix snapped.</p>
<p> Rory seemed taken aback for a moment. &#8220;Well, that's only test number 
  one!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;You sheet chewers can't pass test number two!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The rest of the engineers began to chant &#8220;Test number two! Test number 
  two!&#8221; &#8220;Hitsies&#8221; snarled Rory. &#8220;First man to turn ballpeen 
  loses and goes away and never bothers us again!&#8221; </p>
<p>Felix walked toward the autovidphone. &#8220;This is even more mindless than 
  I gave you engineers credit for. I'm calling security.&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen MacDonald's grey eyes narrowed. He stepped over to the control panel, 
  flipped open a secret breaker bar. Red lights began to flash as MacDonald laid 
  one great hand on a yellow switch marked DESTRUCT 3. </p>
<p>&#8220;Put down that vidciever.&#8221; he said. &#8220;This switch controls 
  the main power flux tensors into this facility. One click and we'll all be pushing 
  up Astroturf.&#8221; </p>
<p>Felix slowly put down the vidceiver. &#8220;You're completely psychotic, MacDonald. 
  Naturally, I had always suspected it from your writings but it is rather unpleasant 
  to have it confirmed in so melodramatic a fashion.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Crazy, Dr. Mahlstadt?&#8221; MacDonald laughed easily.&quot;Or saner 
  than anybody&#8217;s been on this crazy ball of mud for the past five million 
  years!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Crazy. Definitely,&#8221; muttered Wang under his breath. </p>
<p>&#8220;Uh...gee, Glen, couldn&#8217;t we maybe shut down for a little while 
  or something...&#8221; Rory&#8217;s face had turned an ugly slate color.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unnoticed by anyone else, Vandenloos had slipped out of the room. 
</p>
<hr>
<p> The mathematician was walking briskly down the corridor in the opposite direction 
  of any possible explosion. </p>
<p>If I had remained, he reasoned, I could hardly have prevented anything from 
  happening, and since my presence can not actually help the situation, and since 
  my safety is the primary objective in any rational scheme of action, leaving 
  is the most legitimate strategy in this situation. Furthermore, he thought, 
  any sad accident occuring to the engineering and scientific staff of Technicorp 
  might easily free up needed funds for the mathematics division, and, in the 
  absence of the only other leading mathematician in the company, Felix Mahlstadt, 
  I would be very badly needed to head the mathematics division in such an event. 
  Vandenloos whistled the &#8220;Ode To Joy&#8221; under his breath, and his step 
  fell a little lighter the further away from Energylab he got. </p>
<p>As he passed by one door, he noticed that the light was on. From inside the 
  room he could hear, above the roar of GENIAC, the faint but familiar sounds 
  of &#8220;Lesbian Death Dirge&#8221; by Tesco Vee. </p>
<p>Vandenloos hesitated for a moment, then pushed the door open and stepped inside. 
</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was a strong smell of carbon tetrachloride. The 
  second thing was a skinny and extremely dirty young man lying on the floor in 
  a puddle of drool, wearing an outlaw virt- harness hooked up to the GENIAC terminal. 
  The third and fourth things were Phil and Denise. </p>
<p>Denise&#8217; eyes widened and she backed away. </p>
<p>Phil jerked his head out of the bucket of carbon tetrachloride, saw Vandenloos, 
  and passed out. </p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening&#8221; said Vandenloos politely. &#8220;Could you please 
  turn the music down? My name is Erich Vandenloos.&#8221; </p>
<p>Denise turned off the tape player. &#8220;Uh...hi.&#8221; she said, managing 
  a weak smile. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221; said Vandenloos. &#8220;You might want to leave the building, 
  as I believe that a large explosion might occur at any moment. By the way, isn&#8217;t 
  that fellow wearing one of the well-known outlaw virt-harnesses? Why is he exploring 
  the GENIAC virt-world? It&#8217;s so stupid.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;We...we can&#8217;t leave!&#8221; Denise gasped. &#8220;Arvid&#8217;s 
  on the wire! He&#8217;ll go into ECG-shock if we pull him out now.&#8221; </p>
<p>Vandenloos inspected Arvid, frowning. &#8220;Can&#8217;t imagine he has much 
  of a pattern to disrupt.&#8221; Vandenloos pulled the harness off, causing Arvid&#8217;s 
  hapless body to go into convulsions. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll take a look around, 
  if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; he continued, putting on the harness. </p>
<p>Arvid&#8217;s fingers flew across the virt-key punch keys of the virt- terminal. 
</p>
<p>Not long now. The last linkages were in place for direct control of the subatomic 
  energy facility! Soon GENIAC would directly control the power of millions of 
  exploded sub-atomic universes! Lots of power! From the virt-world he could then 
  expand GENIAC&#8217;s control via electromagnetic induction into every computer 
  on the planet. One Big Net! Free long-distance autovidphone calls and pizzarine 
  deliveries for all the Kids! The Master Anarchy Plan! His virt-fingers reached 
  for the last virt keys! </p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried a tiny voice from...somewhere. It sounded like Denise&#8217;s 
  voice but through a hyper-aluminum pipe. Arvid looked around, but everything 
  was losing its coherency, was turning into a pandemonium of colors and voices, 
  and he knew he was being forced off-line. </p>
<p>He felt his own body come back suddenly...too suddenly, and Arvid felt nothing 
  more. </p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;No, Rory,&#8221; Glen shook his head. &#8220;You know what we have to 
  do. We&#8217;ve all talked real brave and said alot of high-sounding words, 
  but if we back down now that&#8217;s all it&#8217;ll be, words.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, MacDonald,&#8221; Kopachevsky exclaimed. &#8220;If it will keep 
  you from blowing the whole funging lab up, I&#8217;ll take up your challenge! 
  Bring on Test number two, if you must.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;No, it has to be Mahlstadt,&#8221; Jim stated. &#8220;He&#8217;s the 
  top-dog in your little group.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;If you think I&#8217;m going to let those degenerates touch me, Mike, 
  you&#8217;re as crazy as they are!&#8221; Felix screamed, making his way back 
  toward the other scientists. </p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; offered Arlene with desperation in her voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m 
  sure we can come to an agreement here. Dr. Mahlstadt, how about if you let them 
  have tonight to finish their project, and if it doesn&#8217;t work, then shut 
  it down in the morning!&#8221;</p>
<p> Calhoun said &#8220;Hey, Glen! We can do it! We almost had it before they 
  showed up! That&#8217;s a fair offer!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! Felix, there&#8217;s no way these crazy goobers can do it! It&#8217;s 
  a great plan,&#8221; Wang chimed in. </p>
<p>At that moment, Kopachevsky lunged at Glen, knocking him away from the DESTRUCT 
  3 switch. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had just about enough of this!&#8221; he yelled 
  and disengaged the switch. </p>
<p>Glen&#8217;s eyes narrowed. His lips pulled back from his teeth in a snarl. 
  His mighty fist swung in a haymaker that connected with Kopachevesky&#8217;s 
  jaw. Kopachevsky staggered back, then delivered a tremendous blow to the giant 
  Scot&#8217;s stomach. </p>
<p>The others stood back, struck with awe at the sight of the two huge men trading 
  blow after blow! The burly Slav slammed Glen MacDonald into a bank of oscillating 
  ontological accumulators, sending showers of sparks flying as the axiomatic 
  switches shorted out. </p>
<p>MacDonald got to his feet and picked up a Fourier table, heaving the giant 
  apparatus at Kopachevsky, who jumped aside just before it crashed through the 
  floor where he had been standing, smashed through three more floors below and 
  finally crushed a Koffee machine in the sub-basement. </p>
<p>A geyser of Koffee shot up through the hole, drenching Mahlstadt and the rest. 
  Slipping in a puddle of Kreem, MacDonald hurled himself at Kopachevsky, who 
  smashed a large ceramik insulator over Glen&#8217;s head. </p>
<p>Glen paused for a second, shook his head, and kept coming. </p>
<p>Once again the two giants traded punches, amid smoke, sparks, and a fine mist 
  of Koffee. </p>
<p>Above them all towered the bi-polar attenuator apparatus, whining and shaking 
  ominously, great arcs of electromagnetic energy playing about the attenuator 
  poles. </p>
<hr>
<p> Vandenloos looked at the virt-terminal and frowned. </p>
<p>Picking up a virt-pencil, he quickly sketched a passable duplicate of his own 
  office in the virt space, using his desk as a &#8220;metaphor&#8221; for the 
  new interface. The Mickey Mouse phone was output, the &#8220;in&#8221; box was 
  input, the desk calculator was a calculator, and the various papers and candy 
  bar wrappers on the desk stood for different memory segments of GENIAC. </p>
<p>He picked up his virt-paperweight and shook it. Looking inside gave an excellent 
  view of Energylab, once the virt-snow had cleared. Apparently some sort of fight 
  had broken out between Kopachevsky and MacDonald, who were now hurling file 
  cabinets at each other. He looked for Mahlstadt, and noted with satisfaction 
  that he was cowering behind a generator with the others. Something brown was 
  raining down on everybody, and the large complicated device in the middle of 
  the room was beginning to shake itself apart. </p>
<p>Vandenloos put a tape of Brahms&#8217; Opus 25 Piano Quartet into his virt-8 
  track tape player, and began looking through the &#8220;papers&#8221; on his 
  &#8220;desk&#8221;. Within milliseconds, he had grasped the complete extent 
  both of the engineer&#8217;s energy project and of the GENIAC operating system. 
</p>
<p>Infinite energy, of course, was of no interest to Vandenloos. However, he noticed 
  that the ability of the engineer&#8217;s machine to reach into the subatomic 
  multiverses might be useful. If, he thought, making a few hasty sums on his 
  &#8220;desk calculator&#8221;, one considered the subatomic suns as &#8220;on-off&#8221; 
  switches, one could very easily construct a digital calculating machine of infinite 
  computational power. </p>
<p>He picked up the Mickey Mouse phone and gave a few direct commands to GENIAC, 
  rerouting the subatomic matrix in a matter of nanoseconds. Quickly looking up 
  the few basic axioms in his virt-library, he programmed the resultant supercomputer 
  to his own purpose... </p>
<hr>
<p>Nearly exhausted, Kopachevsky swung the big condenser by it&#8217;s cable into 
  MacDonald&#8217;s head. </p>
<p>The condenser shattered on MacDonald&#8217;s iron jaw, spattering PVCs everywhere. 
  MacDonald blinked his eyes, then drew back one piledriver-like fist for another 
  punch. </p>
<p>With a sudden groan and a thud, the bi-polar attenuator stopped shaking and 
  giving off smoke. It settled into a soft whirring sound. </p>
<p>MacDonald paused, looking at the great machine. </p>
<p>So did Kopachevsky, dropping the drum of depleted uranium he had picked up. 
</p>
<p>The geyser of Koffee subsided. Cautiously, Felix Mahlstadt and the rest of 
  the scientists and engineers emerged from behind the generator. Arlene came 
  with them, clinging to Felix&#8217;s arm. </p>
<p>&#8220;Energy production!&#8221; boomed Glen in triumph. &#8220;There, Mahlstadt, 
  there&#8217;s your proof! Energy from subatomic annihilation!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense&#8221; said Felix weakly &#8220;It is still a lot of nonsense.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Glen,&#8221; said Jim &#8220;we never sent it the last code! It 
  can&#8217;t be running!&#8221; </p>
<p>Glen strode over to the control panel. He looked at the dials. &#8220;It is 
  running&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;It&#8217;s...it&#8217;s operating directly 
  from GENIAC. But...but Second Order Nexialism clearly contraindicates direct 
  computer control. It&#8217;s a mutant concept!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mutant concept,&#8221; quipped Joe Wang. &#8220;That 
  crazy Second Order Nexialism was discredited at Santa Cruz years ago!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly correct, Wang&#8221; added Mahlstadt. &#8220;Now will you admit 
  failure, MacDonald? Your machine runs, but it produces nothing!&#8221; </p>
<p>Someone behind them cleared his throat. </p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Erich Vandenloos &#8220;but I must disagree, 
  at least partly, with both of you.&#8221; They turned and saw the mathematician 
  behind them. He was followed by Denise, who was supporting a comatose Arvid 
  Schiller. Schiller was wearing a virt-harness attached to a small metal box 
  attached to the small of his back. His eyes were rolled up into his head. </p>
<p>Erich motioned Denise to put Schiller in a convenient chair. </p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Vandenloos?&#8221; said Mahlstadt, with a touch 
  of irritation. </p>
<p>&#8220;Down the hall,&#8221; said Vandenloos &#8220;working on all our problems. 
  I mean that in an extremely general sense.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done to our computer linkage&#8221; growled MacDonald. 
  &#8220;Are you responsible for sabotaging our project?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s self-evidently impossible to sabotage a project that is impossible 
  to begin with&#8221; replied Vandenloos. &#8220;I might well add, that my modifications 
  to your system have transformed a rather tedious technical problem into a fairly 
  interesting result.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, Erich?&#8221; demanded Kopachevsky, idly 
  picking up a steelio bar. &#8220;You math fellows are incessant obscurantists!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious,&#8221; continued Vandenloos, oblivious to both MacDonald&#8217;s 
  and Kopachevsky&#8217;s threatening looks, &#8220;that given a computing engine 
  of sufficient complexity, working from a few simple axioms, it would be possible 
  to construct a Universal Truth Machine. This machine, of course, would have 
  the answer to any possible scientific and technical question, or indeed, the 
  answer to any possible question at all. I have constructed such a machine, using 
  GENIAC to control calculations on the subatomic level through your machine, 
  Mr. MacDonald. I felt that this would be a much more worthwhile use of your 
  technology than some absurd infinite power scheme.&#8221; </p>
<p>Vandenloos walked over to Arvid, who was slumped over in the chair. &#8220;My 
  assistant here suffered an unfortunate accident, during which the patterns of 
  his brain were completely wiped clean. Although this would be an handicap in 
  any other future career, it admirably suits him for use as an interface for 
  my Universal Truth Machine.&#8221; </p>
<p>Rory challenged Vandenloos. &#8220;Have it compute pi to one thousand places!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Vandenloos frowned. He spoke into a microphone attached to Arvid&#8217;s lolling 
  head. </p>
<p>Arvid began to drone: &#8220;Three point one four one five nine...&#8221; </p>
<p>Arvid continued for some minutes, while Rory kept up on his slide rule. At 
  the end, Rory shook his head in amazement. </p>
<p>Kopachevsky sighed in disgust, then stepped forward. &#8220;Is every even number 
  the sum of two odd primes?&#8221; he rumbled. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; came the answer 
  from Arvid&#8217;s blue lips. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; said Joe Wang, &#8220;can he tell me where I lost my copy 
  of &#8216;Don Quixote&#8217;?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;On the bus.&#8221; came the answer. </p>
<p>Felix Mahlstadt came forward, a half-smile on his lips. &#8220;Very amusing, 
  Vandenloos. I admire the neurotic quality of your humor, but this joke has gone 
  far enough. Have your Universal Truth Machine prove this sentence: I cannot 
  be proven by the Universal Truth Machine.&#8221; </p>
<p>In a few short, well-chosen sentences, the answer to Mahlstadt&#8217;s question 
  was quickly given, in a proof unmistakably correct and complete, even elegant. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can see, my Universal Truth Machine works perfectly,&#8221; said 
  Vandenloos, as Denise tried to keep Arvid from falling off the chair, &#8220;and, 
  as long as the interface remains operational, it can answer any possible question. 
  In the event, I don&#8217;t imagine that replacement of the interface would 
  present much of a problem - the eager youth of our society would, I think, provide 
  many suitable subjects. However, a problem does arise. Since my UTM (as I will 
  now proceed to call it) can answer any possible question, it seems to me that 
  the need for the services of scientists and engineers, (or even, alas, mathematicians) 
  might be very greatly reduced.&#8221; </p>
<p>The scientists and engineers looked at each other. </p>
<p>&#8220;I suggest, therefore, cooperation, not conflict. We control GENIAC, 
  and we control the bi-polar attenuator.&#8221; Vandenloos paused. &#8220;It 
  seems to me that not only could we place ourselves at the head of our professions, 
  but that, using the answers provided by the UTM, have a considerable, if not 
  decisive influence on the conduct of society at large.&#8221; </p>
<p>There was silence for a moment. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Glen MacDonald, 
  &#8220;it would be for the advancement of mankind&#8217;s destiny.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can all agree,&#8221; said Felix Mahlstadt, &#8220;that the 
  constraints of unthinking bureaucracy have been bad for the progress of science.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a great idea.&#8221; said Arlene brightly &#8220;and 
  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll need a good PR worker to help things along!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Everybody brightened when they thought of the possibilities of helping mankind. 
</p>
<p>Mahlstadt and MacDonald shook hands. Rory broke out another case of cheap, 
  evil smelling beer. </p>
<p>At that moment, Davis Fenster appeared at the doorway. He walked up to the 
  cheerful group of scientists and engineers. His face turned red as he saw the 
  damage to the lab equipment. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; he demanded 
  angrily. </p>
<p>Everybody laughed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE END </p>
